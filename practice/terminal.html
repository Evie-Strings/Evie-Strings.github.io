		<h1>The Basics</h1>
		<p>Vim is a powerful text editor accessed through the terminal. It can be a little challenging to figure out at first, so here is a small guide to make getting used to it a little bit easier!</p>
		<p>First, you should know how to open and close Vim. Here is a guide on how to do it properly:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>From the terminal, type in <kbd>vim</kbd>, followed by whichever file you want to edit. This will open the vim editor in that file.</li>
			<li>Next, you can make whatever changes you want, using the commands displayed later in this guide.</li>
			<li>When you're ready to close vim, press <kbd>esc :wq</kbd>. This will ensure that you are in normal mode, and then save(w) and close(q). You will then be transported back to the terminal.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>One of the first commands you need to learn in Vim is how to add text. There are two ways of inserting text in Vim, <kbd>i</kbd> or <kbd>a</kbd>. While these two may seem the same, the key difference is that <kbd>i</kbd> inserts text just before your cursor, while <kbd>a</kbd> lets you write anywhere on your page with more ease, starting by moving your cursor one space forward.</p>
		<p>The next thing you need to learn to be successful using Vim is how to delete text. There are a few ways of doing this, so I've broken them down here:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><kbd>x</kbd> is used to delete the character that your cursor is hovering over</li>
			<li><kbd>dw</kbd> is used to delete the word that your cursor is on</li>
			<li><kbd>d$</kbd> is used to delete to the end of the line from wherever your cursor is placed</li>
			<li><kbd>dd</kbd> is used to delete the entire line, regardless of where your cursor is placed</li>
		</ul>
