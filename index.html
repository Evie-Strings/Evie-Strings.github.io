		<h1>A website being built for my Web Design Class</h1>
		<h2>Progress will be slow</h2>
		<p>I am going to be using this webstite to keep a log of my 		theater progress, art, robotics, and maybe some writing. It won't be interesting to anyone but me!</p>
		<p>My favorite quote is 
		<q>It's not homemade pasta if it doesn't look like Australia</q> - Todd C. Viola</p>
