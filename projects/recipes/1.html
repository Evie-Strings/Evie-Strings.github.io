		<h1>Homemade Gnocchi</h1>
		<h2>History of this Recipe</h2>
		<p>Gnocchi has always been a rare, special meal in my life, even though it's not actually that hard to make. Gnocchi was always a birthday meal, though I don't know who started this tradition.  Once I was old enough and tall enough to help out with cooking, I got to spin the crank and shape the gnocchi, and it was always the best part of my birthday. I've written the recipe for the gnocchi here, but not any sort of sauce to put on your pasta. We've always made it with tomato sauce or gorgonzola sauce, but feel free to top it with whatever sauce you want.</p>
		<p>While not truly related to making gnocchi, whenever I think about making gnocchi I think about this quote from my dad. <q>It's not homemade pasta if it doesn't look like Australia.</q> - Todd C. Viola.</p>

		<h2>Equipment Substitutions</h2>
		<p>To make this recipe effectivly, I recommend having a gnocchi maker to make forming the gnocchi's shape easier. If you don't have a gnocchi maker than you can roll out your dough into long strings and cut it into pieces that are about an inch. Take your thumb and press it into one side of the piece of dough. Roll your thumb away from you over the piece of dough on top of a cut glass dish so that the dough rolls around your thumb. Repeat this step for all the pieces of dough.</p>
